# JavaScript Variables

## Variables and Constants

**Variables are containers for storing data** - **a data storage**.

- All JavaScript **variables** must be defined with **unique names**.
- These unique names are called **identifiers**.
- **Identifiers** can be short names or more descriptive names.

```js
// Variable declaration
var number;

// Variable initialization
number = 100;

// Variable declaration and initialization
var number = 100;

// Multiple variable declarations
var number1, number2, number3;
number1 = 1;
number2 = 2;
number3 = 3;

// Multiple variable declarations and initializations
var number1 = 1,
  number2 = 2,
  number3 = 3;

var number1,
  number2,
  number3 = 1000;

// A data storage, where the variable can be re-declared and the value can change
var car = "BMW";
var car = "AUDI";
var car = "Mercedes-Benz";

// A data storage, where the variable cannot be re-declared and the value can change
let car = "BMW";
car = "AUDI";

// A data storage, where the variable cannot be re-declared and the value cannot change
const car = "BMW";
```

We should always declare variables with **const**, and only if we think the value of the variable can change we should use **let**. Use constants as often as possible, whenever you got data that never changes, to be clear about your intentions in your code.

## Variable Declarations

There are 4 ways to declare a JavaScript variables using different keywords:

- Variables declared using the keyword **_var_**:

  - is globally-scoped when declared in global scope
  - is function-scoped when declared inside a function
  - is re-declarable
  - is re-assignable
  - is subject to hoisting
  - is not subject to the temporal dead zone (the state where variables are unreachable)
  - creates a global property on window object with the same name

- Variables declared using the keyword **_let_**:

  - is block-scoped - accessible only within the block it has been declared
  - is not re-declarable
  - is re-assignable
  - is subject to the temporal dead zone
  - it does not create a global property on window

- Variables declared using the keyword **_const_**:

  - is block-scoped - accessible only within the block it has been declared
  - is not re-declarable
  - is not re-assignable
  - is subject to the temporal dead zone
  - it does not create a global property on window
  - must always be initialized, not just declared
  - is preferable to let whenever is possible, when the value does not need to change
  - even though const is not re-assignable, we can still manipulate non-primitive (reference) types like objects, arrays etc...

- Variables declared using **_nothing_**:

## Naming Variables

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $, #, and \_
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- Names are case sensitive
- Reserved words cannot be used as names

```js
// allowed
let userName; // Best practice use camelCase
let ageGroup5;
let $kindOfSpecial;
let #privateProperty;
let _internalValue;

// not allowed
let user_name; // Allowed, but bad practice
let 21players;
let user-b;
let let;
```

## Shadowed Variables

In computer programming, variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (decision block, method, or inner class) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. At the level of identifiers (names, rather than variables), this is known as name masking. This outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner identifier is said to mask the outer identifier. This can lead to confusion, as it may be unclear which variable subsequent uses of the shadowed variable name refer to, which depends on the name resolution rules of the language.

## JavaScript Dynamic Typing

JavaScript is **loosely typed** and **dynamic**. This means that variables are not directly associated with any particular data type. Any variable can be assigned, and re-assigned, values of all data types.

**Advantages of Strongly Typed:**

- catch errors at compile time (not run-time)
- more chances for performance enhancements
- code can be easier to understand

**Disadvantages of Strongly Typed:**

- programmer has less flexibility
- application development may be slower

**Advantages of Loosely Typed:**

- more programmer flexibility
- code may run faster

**Disadvantages of Loosely Typed:**

- many bugs not caught until run-time
- code may be more difficult to understand

## JavaScript Data Types

- **Numbers** - Important for calculations and code where you need to work with a number
- **Strings** (Text) - Important for outputting results, gathering input
- **Booleans** - Important for conditional code and situations where you only have 2 options
- **Objects** - Important for grouped/related data, helps to organize data
- **Arrays** - Important for list data, unknown amounts of data
- **Symbol** - Returns a unique value every time. Can be used as keys for object properties, to avoid name collisions among multiple libraries.
- **BigInt** - Important for working with big numbers
- **undefined** - typically variable declared but not defined. Default value of uninitialized variables, we should not assign undefined as a value manually. It is also a value of non-existent object properties.
- **null** - refers to a value that is empty or non-existent value. Never assumed by default, the only way that something can get the values of null is if you assign the value of null. Can be used to reset or clear a variable.

## Primitive & Reference Types

There are two categories of types/values in JavaScript:

**Primitive Values:**

- Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Symbol, undefined, null
- Stored in memory (normally on Stack, variable stores value itself)
- Copying a variable - assign to different variable (copies the value)

**Reference Values:**

- All other objects that are more complex or expensive to create
- Stored in memory (Heap), variable stores a pointer (address) to location in memory
- Copying a variable (means assign to different values) copies the pointer/reference

## Garbage Collection

JavaScript Engine periodically checks Heap for unused objects, objects without references and removes the unused objects. These are called memory leaks. **Memory Leaks** are **unused objects where we still hold references to it.**
