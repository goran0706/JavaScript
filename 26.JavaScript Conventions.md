# JavaScript Conventions

Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects.

Coding conventions are **style guidelines for programming**. They typically cover:

- Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
- Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
- Programming practices and principles

Coding conventions **secure quality:**

- Improves code readability
- Make code maintenance easier

---

**Variable Names:**

- Use camelCase
- All names start with a letter.
- Variable and function names written as camelCase
- Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
- Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE

**Spaces Around Operators:**

- Always put spaces around operators ( = + - \* / ), and after commas:

**Code Indentation:**

- Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks - Do not use tabs (tabulators) for indentation. Different editors interpret tabs differently.

**General rules for simple statements:**

- Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.

  ```js
  const cars = ['Volvo', 'Saab', 'Fiat'];
  ```

**General rules for complex (compound) statements:**

- Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
- Use one space before the opening bracket.
- Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
- Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

  ```js
  const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: 'blue',
  };
  ```

**Functions:**

- Prefer writing Pure Functions

```js
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
```

**Loops:**

```js
// BAD PRACTICE, avoid using the length property as it is checked in each  iteration
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){...}

// GOOD PRACTICE
// cache the length of the collection before the iteration begins.
const length = array.length
for (let i = 0; i < length; i++){...}

for (let i = 0, length = array.length; i < length; i++){...}

// writing i= i+ 1 instead of i++ to avoid ‘excessive trickiness’
for (let i = i + 1, length = array.length; i < length;){...}

// write the for loop in a decremental fashion because
// it is usually faster to compare to 0 than to the length of an array.
for (let i = array.length; i > 0; i--){...}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  x += i;
}
```

**Conditionals:**

```js
if (time < 20) {
  greeting = 'Good day';
} else {
  greeting = 'Good evening';
}
```

**General rules for object definitions:**

- Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
- Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
- Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
- Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
- Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
- Always end an object definition with a semicolon.

  ```js
  const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: 'blue',
  };
  ```

- Short objects can be written compressed, on one line, using spaces only between properties, like this:

  ```js
  const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: 'blue',
  };
  ```

**Line Length < 80:**

- For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters.
- If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.

**File Extensions:**

- HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).
- CSS files should have a .css extension.
- JavaScript files should have a .js extension.

**Use Lower Case File Names:**
