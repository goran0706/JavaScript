# JavaScript Control Structures

## Conditional statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use **if** to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
- Use **else** to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
- Use **else if** to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
- Use **switch** to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
- Use **ternary operator** instead of **if - else**. The conditional (Ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement. Don't abuse the ternary operator. Too many conditions/values can lead to complex code. It is useful tool when we need a conditional for a quick check.

**if:**

```js
if (a < b) {
  console.log("b is greater than a");
}
```

**else:**

```js
if (a < b) {
  console.log("b is greater than a");
} else {
  console.log("a is greater than b");
}
```

**else if:**

```js
if (a < b) {
  console.log("b is greater than a");
} else if (number1 > number2) {
  console.log("a is greater than b");
} else {
  console.log("Both are equal");
}
```

**Ternary Operator:**

```js
var day = today === 0 ? "Saturday" : "Today is not sunday";
```

If you have too many if-else constructs then it is usually advisable to use a switch statement.

- The switch expression is evaluated once
- the value of the expression is compared with each case value
- if the values match the code block is executed
- if no match is found, the default code block executed
- fall-through can be used
- switch uses strict equality

**switch:**

```js
switch (expression) {
  case a:
    // code to execute
    break;
  case b:
    // code to execute
    break;
  case c:
    // code to execute
    break;
  default:
    // code to execute
    break;
}
```

```js
function getProductInventory(fruit) {
  var count;

  switch (fruit) {
    case "banana":
      count: 100;
      break;
    case "blueberry":
    case "strawberry":
    case "blackberry":
      break;
      count: {
        "blueberry": 20,
        "strawberry": 100,
        "blackberry": 50,
      }
    case "orange":
      count: 100;
      break;
    default:
      count = 0;
  }
  return count;
}
```
