# JavaScript Loops

We use loops to execute code multiple times

## _for_ loop

Execute a certain amount of times (with counter variable). The **_for_** loop construct has 3 expressions: an initialization expression; a conditional expression; an increment expression. After these three expression is the code to be executed with each loop iteration. Note, that none of the three expressions is required. If the condition expression is missing then it is assumed to be true, turning it into an infinitive loop. If you omit the condition expression ensure the code block has a **_break_** statement. The test variable can be initialized and changed in various ways, according to your requirements. The three expressions can involve multiple variables. If the test condition never becomes false, the infinite loop will run forever! Code in loop body is executed until the condition is false.

```js
for (;;) {
  console.log("Hello World");
  x++;
  if (x > 10) {
    break;
  }
}

// Bad - length property of an array each time the loop is iterated.
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  // execute code
}

// Better
let l = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {
  // execute code
}

// cached length
for (let i = 0, n = arr.length; i < n; i++;) {
  // execute code
}

// reversed
for (ley i = arr.length; i--;) {
  // execute code
}
```

## _for...in_ loop

Execute for all enumerable properties of an object having string keys, tho symbol keys are ignored. In addition to the value, object properties have hidden flags, and one of them indicates if the property is enumerable - it is set to true by default in most cases. The for in loop also iterate over the inherited properties, if we want to iterate over the object's properties only then we can use **_hasOwnProperty_**

- for...in iterates over properties in arbitrary order
- do not add, modify, or remove properties in for...in
- don't use for...in to iterate arrays, use for...of
- for...in most commonly used during debugging

```js
for (const key in obj) {
  // execute code
}
```

## _for...of_ loop

Execute for each object property:

- for...in iterates over properties
- for...of iterates over values
- for...of can iterate String, Array, array-like objects, etc...
- use for...of to iterate over return of DOM API methods.

```js
for (const el of array) {
  // execute code
}
```

## _while...do_ loop

Execute as long as a condition is true. Code in loop body is executed until the test condition is false. The condition is evaluated before the body code is executed. "break" will cause the loop to immediately end, regardless of the test condition.

```js
while (isLoggedIn) {
  // execute code
}
```

## do...while loop

Code in loop body is executed until the test condition is false. The loop body code executes before the condition is evaluated, so it runs at least once.

```js
do {
  // execute code
} while (isLoggedIn);
```

## Controlling Loops with _break_

**_break_** terminates the current loop or switch statement, and transfers control to the statement following the terminated loop statement. Tho you can have a break statement inside a function that is inside a loop (Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement).

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Controlling Loops with _continue_

**_continue_** terminates execution of the current iteration if the current loop, and continues execution of the next iteration.
When used in a for loop, continue results in the loop iteration ending, and you return to the update expression, the third expression in parentheses.

When used in a while loop, continue, ends the loop iteration, and you return to the condition.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

## More control with Labeled Statements

```js
let i, j;

loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  //The first for statement is labeled "loop1"
  loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    //The second for statement is labeled "loop2"
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
      break loop1;
    }
    console.log(`i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
  }
}
```
