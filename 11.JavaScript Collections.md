# JavaScript Collections

## What is an Iterable?

Objects that implements the "iterable" protocol and have an @@iterator method (i.e. Symbol.iterator). But not every iterable is an array! Other iterables are NodeList, String, Map, Set.

**Arrays:**

Arrays are like containers, like boxes with slots to store pieces of data.

- Arrays are list-like objects
- Access items and change them with indexes
- Array indexes are integers
- Array lengths and element types are not fixed
- Data can be stored at non-contiguous locations
- Array prototype has many methods and properties
- Multidimensional arrays

- Store (nested) data of any kind and length
- Iterable, also many special array methods available
- Order is guaranteed
- Duplicates are allowed
- Zero-based index to access elements

Array Indexes:

- array indexes start at 0
- array indexes are integers
- access array elements with indexes
- change array elements with indexes

Array Methods:

- Mutative
- Non-mutative

**Sets:**

- Store (nested) data of any kind and length
- Iterable, also some special set methods available
- Order is not guaranteed
- Duplicates are not allowed
- No index-based access

- Stores unique values of any type
- Primitive values or object references
- iterate through elements in insertion order
- any value can only occur once in a Set
- size property returns number of values
- _add(value)_ appends value, returns the changed Set
- _clear()_ removes all values
- _delete(value)_ removes value, returns result boolean
- _has(value)_ returns boolean indicating presence in Set
- _keys()_ iterator yielding values for each element
- _values()_ same as keys
- _entries()_ returns iterator with an array of [value, value]
- _forEach(callback, this)_ calls callback for each value

**Maps:**

- Store key/value data of any kind and length, any key values are allowed
- Iterable, also some special map methods available
- Order is guaranteed
- Duplicate keys are not allowed
- Key-based access
- stores key/value pairs for entries
- any key/value, primitives and objects
- remembers insertion order of keys
- for...of returns array of [key, value]
- Map very similar to Object
- Map has no default keys, Object does
- Map any keys, Object String & Symbol
- Map more reliable for order of keys
- size property number of items
- Map is iterable, Object more involved
- Map performance better for adds/removals
- _set()_ to store data, _get()_ to retrieve
- _maMap["model"]_ not correct
- _has()_ checks if entry exists
- _delete()_ removes entry
- _clear()_ removes all key/value pairs
- _keys()_ returns iterator with Map keys
- _values()_ returns iterator with Map values
- _entries()_ returns array of [key, value] entries
- _forEach(callback, this)_ callback called for each entry

## Maps vs Objects

**Maps:**

- Can use any values (and types) as keys
- Better performance for large quantities of data
- Better performance when adding + removing data frequently

**Objects:**

- Only may use strings, numbers or symbols as keys
- Perfect for small/medium-sized sets of data
- Easier/quicker to create (typically also with better performance)

**NodeList:**

- Collections of DOM nodes
- Node.childNodes returns NodeList
- document.querySelectorAll() return NodeList
- NodeList is array-like but is not an array
- can iterate NodeList with forEach()
- convert to true array with Array.from()
- live and static NodeLists
- length returns number of items
- _item(idx)_ item at index, or null if out of bounds
- _entries()_ returns iterator for key/value pairs
- _key()_ returns iterator for keys
- _values()_ returns iterator for values
- _forEach(callback, this)_ execute for each items

## Arrays

JavaScript arrays are a collection of anything. JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. It can hold more than one value and of any type at a time. An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number. Arrays are a special type of object. The _typeof_ operator in JavaScript returns “object” for arrays. A better way to check for arrays type is by calling:

```js
const numbers = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"];
const index = 1;

// Creates an array from an iterable object.
// @param iterable — An iterable object to convert to an array.
Array.from();

// Returns a new array from a set of elements.
// @param items — A set of elements to include in the new array object.
Array.of();

// The Array.isArray() method determines whether the passed value is an Array.
Array.isArray();

// Returns an iterable of key, value pairs for every entry in the array
numbers.entries();

// Returns an iterable of keys in the array
numbers.keys();

// Returns an iterable of values in the array
numbers.values();

// Removes the last element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
numbers.pop();

// Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
// @param items — New elements to add to the array.
numbers.push();

// Removes the first element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
numbers.shift();

// Inserts new elements at the start of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
// @param items — Elements to insert at the start of the array.
numbers.unshift();

// Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.
// @param start — The zero-based location in the array from which to start removing elements.
// @param deleteCount — The number of elements to remove.
// @returns — An array containing the elements that were deleted.
numbers.splice();

// Returns the item located at the specified index.
// @param index — The zero-based index of the desired code unit. A negative index will count back from the last item.
numbers.at();

// Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array, or -1 if it is not present.
// @param searchElement — The value to locate in the array.
// @param fromIndex — The array index at which to begin the search. If fromIndex is omitted, the search starts at index 0.
numbers.indexOf();

// Returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified value in an array, or -1 if it is not present.
// @param searchElement — The value to locate in the array.
// @param fromIndex — The array index at which to begin searching backward. If fromIndex is omitted, the search starts at the last index in the array.
numbers.lastIndexOf();

// Returns the index of the first element in the array where predicate is true, and -1 otherwise.
// @param predicate find calls predicate once for each element of the array, in ascending order, until it finds one where predicate returns true. If such an element is found, findIndex immediately returns that element index. Otherwise, findIndex returns -1.
// @param thisArg If provided, it will be used as the this value for each invocation of predicate. If it is not provided, undefined is used instead.
numbers.findIndex();

// The findLast() method returns the value of the last element in an array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
numbers.findLast();

// The findLastIndex() method returns the index of the last element in an array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, -1 is returned.
numbers.findLastIndex();

// Changes all array elements from start to end index to a static value and returns the modified array
// @param value — value to fill array section with
// @param start index to start filling the array at. If start is negative, it is treated as length+start where length is the length of the array.
// @param end index to stop filling the array at. If end is negative, it is treated as length+end.
numbers.fill();

// Combines two or more arrays. This method returns a new array without modifying any existing arrays.
// @param items — Additional arrays and/or items to add to the end of the array.
numbers.concat();

// Returns the this object after copying a section of the array identified by start and end to the same array starting at position target
// @param target If target is negative, it is treated as length+target where length is the length of the array.
// @param start If start is negative, it is treated as length+start. If end is negative, it is treated as length+end.
// @param end — If not specified, length of the this object is used as its default value.
numbers.copyWithin(callbackfn);

// Returns a copy of a section of an array. For both start and end, a negative index can be used to indicate an offset from the end of the array. For example, -2 refers to the second to last element of the array.
// @param start The beginning index of the specified portion of the array. If start is undefined, then the slice begins at index 0.
// @param end The end index of the specified portion of the array. This is exclusive of the element at the index 'end'. If end is undefined, then the slice extends to the end of the array.
numbers.slice();

// Adds all the elements of an array into a string, separated by the specified separator string.
// @param separator — A string used to separate one element of the array from the next in the resulting string. If omitted, the array elements are separated with a comma.
numbers.join();

// Returns a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.
// @param depth — The maximum recursion depth
numbers.flat();

// Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array. Then, flattens the result into a new array. This is identical to a map followed by flat with depth 1.
// @param callback A function that accepts up to three arguments. The flatMap method calls the callback function one time for each element in the array.
// @param thisArg An object to which the this keyword can refer in the callback function. If thisArg is omitted, undefined is used as the this value.
numbers.flatMap();

// Performs the specified action for each element in an array.
// @param callbackfn — A function that accepts up to three arguments. forEach calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
// @param thisArg — An object to which the this keyword can refer in the callbackfn function. If thisArg is omitted, undefined is used as the this value.
numbers.forEach();

// Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.
// @param callbackfn — A function that accepts up to three arguments. The map method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
// @param thisArg — An object to which the this keyword can refer in the callbackfn function. If thisArg is omitted, undefined is used as the this value.
numbers.map();

// Sorts an array in place. This method mutates the array and returns a reference to the same array.
// @param compareFn Function used to determine the order of the elements. It is expected to return a negative value if the first argument is less than the second argument, zero if they're equal, and a positive value otherwise. If omitted, the elements are sorted in ascending, ASCII character order.
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

// Reverses the elements in an array in place. This method mutates the array and returns a reference to the same array.
numbers.reverse();

// Determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.
// @param searchElement — The element to search for.
// @param fromIndex — The position in this array at which to begin searching for searchElement.
numbers.includes();

// A function that accepts up to three arguments. The filter method calls the predicate function one time for each element in the array.
// Returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.
numbers.filter();

// Returns the value of the first element in the array where predicate is true, and undefined otherwise.
// @param predicate find calls predicate once for each element of the array, in ascending order, until it finds one where predicate returns true. If such an element is found, find immediately returns that element value. Otherwise, find returns undefined.
// @param thisArg If provided, it will be used as the this value for each invocation of predicate. If it is not provided, undefined is used instead.
numbers.find();

// Determines whether all the members of an array satisfy the specified test.
// @param predicate A function that accepts up to three arguments. The every method calls the predicate function for each element in the array until the predicate returns a value which is coercible to the Boolean value false, or until the end of the array.
// @param thisArg An object to which the this keyword can refer in the predicate function. If thisArg is omitted, undefined is used as the this value.
numbers.every();

// Determines whether the specified callback function returns true for any element of an array.
// @param predicate A function that accepts up to three arguments. The some method calls the predicate function for each element in the array until the predicate returns a value which is coercible to the Boolean value true, or until the end of the array.
// @param thisArg An object to which the this keyword can refer in the predicate function. If thisArg is omitted, undefined is used as the this value.
numbers.some();

// Calls the specified callback function for all the elements in an array. The return value of the callback function is the accumulated result, and is provided as an argument in the next call to the callback function.
// @param callbackfn — A function that accepts up to four arguments. The reduce method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
// @param initialValue — If initialValue is specified, it is used as the initial value to start the accumulation. The first call to the callbackfn function provides this value as an argument instead of an array value.
numbers.reduce();

// Calls the specified callback function for all the elements in an array, in descending order. The return value of the callback function is the accumulated result, and is provided as an argument in the next call to the callback function.
// @param callbackfn — A function that accepts up to four arguments. The reduceRight method calls the callbackfn function one time for each element in the array.
// @param initialValue — If initialValue is specified, it is used as the initial value to start the accumulation. The first call to the callbackfn function provides this value as an argument instead of an array value.
numbers.reduceRight();

// Returns a string representation of an array.
numbers.toString();

// Returns a string representation of an array. The elements are converted to string using their toLocaleString methods.
numbers.toLocaleString();
```

## Sets

Sets are collections of unique items.

```js
const fruitSet = new Set();
fruitSet.add("apples");
fruitSet.add("apples");
fruitSet.add("bananas");
fruitSet.has("bananas");
fruitSet.size;
fruitSet.delete("bananas");
fruitSet.clear();
```

Iterating over Sets

```js
for (const fruit of fruitSet) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

for (const key of fruitSet.keys()) {
  console.log("keys:", key);
}

for (const value of fruitSet.values()) {
  console.log("values:", value);
}

for (const [key, value] of fruitSet.entries()) {
  console.log("entries:", key, value);
}
```

**Union of Sets** - contains all elements from both A and B.

```js
const fruits = new Set(["apples", "grapes", "oranges", "grapes"]);
const fruits2 = ["apples", "bananas", "plums"];
const allFruits = new Set([...fruits, ...fruits2]);
```

**Intersection of Sets** - contains elements that are part of A and B.

```js
const fruits = new Set(["apples", "grapes"]);
const fruits2 = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);
const sameFruits = new Set([...fruits].filter((fruit) => fruits2.has(fruit)));
```

**Difference of Sets** - contains elements that are part of A but not in B.

```js
const fruits = new Set(["apples", "grapes"]);
const fruits2 = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);
const differentFruits = new Set(
  [...fruits].filter((fruit) => !fruits2.has(fruit))
);
```

## Maps

A map is a collection of key/value pairs, similar to objects, but maps allow keys of any type.

```js
const fruitMap = new Map();
fruitMap.set("fruit1", "apple");
fruitMap.set("fruit2", "orange");
fruitMap.get("fruit1");
fruitMap.has("fruit1");
fruitMap.delete("fruit1");
fruitMap.clear("fruit1");
```

Iterating over maps

```js
for (const fruit of fruitMap) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

for (const key of fruitMap.keys()) {
  console.log("keys:", key);
}

for (const value of fruitMap.values()) {
  console.log("values:", value);
}

for (const [key, value] of fruitMap.entries()) {
  console.log("entries:", key, value);
}
```

## WeakSet vs WeakMap

WeakSet and WeakMap are advanced concepts that are very rarely used but can help us to better manage the memory use in large applications when we have data that is to be deleted or garbage collected but we don't want to do it manually. Both accept objects as value and store a reference, when the reference is deleted the JavaScript Engine garbage collects and removes the items from both WeakSet and WeakMap.
