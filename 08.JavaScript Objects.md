# JavaScript Objects

## Definition

- JavaScript objects are containers for named values called **properties**.
- Objects are collections of properties and methods
- Properties have values
- Objects properties are like variables but attached to object
- Methods are functions, and methods are properties
- Spaces and line breaks are ignored
- Access/set with dot notation or brackets
- **_this_** is the owner of the function
- Objects can also have **methods**.
- Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
- A method is a function stored as a property.
- Methods are stored in properties as **function definitions**.

## Creating objects

- **Object initializer** (object literal)
- **Object.create()** (pure inheritance)
- **Constructor function**
- **ES6 Classes**

## Creating Objects – Object Literals

```js
// Object literal
const Person = {
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName: "Alicea",
  address: {
    street: "111 Main St.",
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY",
  },
};
```

## Creating Objects – Object.create and Pure Prototype Inheritance

Inheritance – one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.
Prototypes are a convenient means of defining properties and functionality that will be automatically accessible to other objects. Prototypes serve a similar purpose to that of classes in classical object-oriented languages.

The main use of prototypes in JavaScript is in producing code written in an object-oriented way. The idea of prototyping is simple. Every object can have a reference to its prototype, an object to which the search for a particular property can be delegated to, if the object itself doesn't have that property.

```js
const personPrototype = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  getFullName() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const john = Object.create(personPrototype);
```

## Creating Objects – Constructor Function

Constructor Function is a normal function that is used to construct objects. The ‘this’ variable points a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.

```js
function Person(firstname, lastname) {
  this.firstname = firstname;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe");

// Prototype - The prototype property is used only by the new operator.
function Person(firstname, lastname) {
  this.firstname = firstname;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  console.log(this.firstname + " " + this.lastname);
};

const john = new Person("John", "Doe");
```

## Creating Objects – ES6 Classes

ES6 Class is a syntactical sugar – a different way to type something that doesn’t change how it works under the hood.
Static methods are defined on a class level, accessible directly via the class itself, not it's instances. They belong to the class.

```js
class Person extends Object {
  constructor(firstname, lastname) {
    super();
    this.firstname = firstname;
    this.lastname = lastname;
  }

  get firstName() {
    return this.firstName;
  }

  set firstName(value) {
    this.firstName = value;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log("Say Hi!");
  }

  static sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe");
```

## Class Definition vs Class Expression

```js
class Person {}

const Person = class {};
```

## Enhanced Objects

```js
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";

const obj = {
  // firstName: "John",
  // lastName: "Doe",
  firstName,
  lastName,
};
```

## Accessing Object Properties

```js
const person = new Object();
person["firstName"] = "Tony";
person["lastName"] = "Alice";

const firstNameProperty = "firstName";

// Object bracket notation
console.log(person[firstNameProperty]);
console.log(person["lastName"]);

// Object dot notation
console.log(person.firstName);
console.log(person.lastName);
```

- Use dot notation as a preferred way for accessing object properties.
- Use bracket notation when you need to access object properties programmatically, based on dynamic string or something similar.

## Deleting Object Properties

We can use the delete methods to remove an object property

```js
var obj = new Object();
obj.x = 100;
obj.y = 200;
delete obj.x;
```

## Object Property Merging vs Object Spreading vs Extract Object Properties

An alternative to object property spreading is to use Object.assign(), which returns an object with merged properties.
We can also use this to create a copy of an object.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Tom",
  age: 32,
};

const person2 = Object.assign({}, person); // objects merging
const person3 = { ...person }; // object spreading
const { name, age } = person; // object destructuring
```

## Objects Can Inherit Properties (Inheritance in JavaScript)

- Objects in JavaScript are collections of properties
- JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object
- Objects inherit from the prototype object, inherit from the prototype's prototype, etc.
- Properties can be shadowed

## Instance and Object Type Properties

- Instance properties are those that belong to an instance
- Object Type properties are those that are shared by all instances of an Object Type

Objects Own properties are those that are unique to objects instance. The **_hasOwnProperty(prop)_** method can be used to checks if a property is an instance property.

## Defining Getters and Setters

- getters retrieve property values
- setters set property value
- define getters/setters in object initializer
- define getters/setters with **_defineProperties()_**

## Manipulating Objects

- fromEntries()
- assign()
- ... spread operator
- preventExtensions()
- sea()
- freeze()

```js
var entries = [
  ["apple", 2.49],
  ["orange", 3.49],
  ["banana", 1.49],
];
var obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(obj);
```

```js
var obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
var obj2 = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };
var obj3 = { ax: 1, by: 2, ca: 3 };

var returnedObject = Object.assign(obj1, obj2, obj3);
console.log(returnedObject);
```

```js
var obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
var obj2 = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };
var obj3 = { ax: 1, by: 2, ca: 3 };

var mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2, ...obj3 };
console.log(mergedObj);
```

```js
var car = { make: "Ford", model: "Fusion", year: 2020 };
console.log(car);
var nonExtensibleObject = Object.preventExtensions(car);
car.color = "blue"; // prevents adding new own properties
car.model = "Fiesta"; // works
delete car.year; // works

var sealedObject = Object.seal(car);
delete car.year; // cannot delete properties
// cannot convert data properties into getters and setters
```

## Enumerating Object Properties

- for...in loop
- Object.keys(obj)
- Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)

## Iterate Objects

```js
Object.entries(obj).forEach((key) => console.log(key));
Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => console.log(key));
Object.values(obj).forEach((key) => console.log(key));
```

## Object Spreading

- expand object expressions
- expand array expressions
- expand strings

```js
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 31,
};
const newObj = { ...obj };
const { firstKey, ...restKeys } = obj;
```

## Object Destructuring

Unpack arrays and object properties.

- Set default values in case unpacked value is undefined.
- In arrays values can be swapped during destructuring
- Declaration can be separate from assignment
- Assigning to new variable names and default values
- Unpacking fields from objects passed as function parameters

```js
const user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

const { firstName, lastName } = user;
console.log(firstName, lastName);
```

## Configuring object properties

In JavaScript, every object property is described with a property descriptor through which we can configure the following keys:

- **configurable** - if set to true, the property's descriptor can be changed and the property can be deleted. If set to false, we can do neither of these things.
- **enumerable** - if set to true, the property shows up during a for-in loop over the object's properties.
- **value** - specifies the value of the property. Defaults to undefined.
- **writable** - if set to true, the property value can be changed by using an assignment
- **get** - defines the getter function, which will be called when we access the property. Can't be defined in conjunction with value and writable
- **set** - defines the setter function, which will be called whenever an assignment is made to the property. Also can't be defined in conjunction with value and writable

```js
const fruit = {};
fruit.name = "apple";
fruit.color = "green";

Object.defineProperty(fruit, "tasty", {
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false,
  value: true,
  writable: true,
});

for (const key in fruit) {
  if (Object.hasOwnProperty.call(fruit, key)) {
    const element = fruit[key];
    console.log(element);
  }
}
```

```js
let example1 = {
  test: 1,
  test2: {
    test: 1,
  },
  test3: function () {
    return "test3";
  },
};

// METHODS:

// assign
let example2 = example1; // passed by reference, both refer to the same object
let example3 = Object.assign({}, example1); // create new object from object

// keys
console.log(Object.keys(example1));

// values
console.log(Object.values(example1));

// entries
console.log(Object.entries(example1));

// is
console.log(Object.is(example1, example2));
console.log(Object.is(example1, example3));
console.log(Object.is(example2, example3));

// freeze
console.log(Object.freeze(example1));
example1.test = 123;
console.log(example1);

// isFrozen
console.log(Object.isFrozen(example1));
console.log(Object.isFrozen(example2));
console.log(Object.isFrozen(example3));

// hasOwnProperty
console.log(example1.hasOwnProperty("test"));

// hasOwn
console.log(Object.hasOwn(example1, "test"));
```
