# JavaScript

## Definition

JavaScript is a **high-level**, **single threaded**, **garbage collected**, **interpreted** or **JIT compiled**, **prototype based**,
**multi-paradigm**, **dynamic language** with a **non-blocking event loop**(without blocking the main thread).

- Anything that can be built with JavaScript, will be built with JavaScript.

**JavaScript** is a **high-level**, often **just-in-time compiled (JIT)**, **single-threaded** language.

- It has **dynamic typing**, **prototype-based object-orientation**, and **first-class functions**.
- It is **multi-paradigm**, supporting **procedural**, **object-oriented**, **functional**, **event-driven** and **imperative programming styles**.
- It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
- It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (‘host environment’).

**Interpreted Programming Language:**

- Code is not-precompiled, instead parsed and compiled “on the fly” (i.e. in the browser)
- Code is evaluated and executed at runtime
- Code can change at runtime

**Weakly Typed Programming Language:**

- Data types are assumed automatically
- Data types can change
- Data types are not explicitly defined, we don’t declare variables of certain type

**Browser-side:**

- JavaScript was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser!
- JavaScript can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background HTTP requests & much more
- JavaScript cannot access the local filesystem, it cannot interact with the operating system, etc.

**Server-side:**

- Google's JavaScript Engine V8 was extracted to run JavaScript anywhere called Node.js
- Node.js can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used to build web backends (server-side JavaScript)
- Node.js can access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc... but cannot manipulate HTML or CSS

## JavaScript Programs

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be executed by a computer. In a programming language, these instructions are called **statements**. A **JavaScript program** is a list of programming **statements**.

**JavaScript statements** are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords and Comments. Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. The statements are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written.

## JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed. The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values - called **Literals**
- Variable values - called **Variables**

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

- Numbers are written with or without decimals
- Strings are text, written within single, double quotes or backticks

```js
// literals
10.99;
100;
("John Doe");
"John Doe"`John Doe`;

// variables
const num = 10.99;
const name = "John";
```

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are **case sensitive**. JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter.

## JavaScript Comments

```js
// this is a single line comment
var vehicle = "car"; // you can add comments after code, not before
```

```js
/* 
  this is a multi-line comment.
    The comment is on multiple lines.
      This is the third line of the comment.
*/
var /* declare count */ count = /* assign value to count */ 10; // multiline comment
```

```js
/**
 * JavaScript doc
 * @param {number} num1 - First number
 * @param {number} num2 - Second number
 * @returns {number} The addition of both numbers
 *
 */
function foo(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

## JavaScript Execution

The code is **parsed**, **compiled** and **executed** from top to bottom by the JavaScript Engine that does the following:

- Parse Code
- Compile to Machine Code (on the fly or just-in-time)
- Execute Machine Code (on a Single Thread)

## JavaScript Programming Paradigm

- **Procedural** Programming
- **Object-oriented** Programming
- **Functional** Programming

## Ways to Include JavaScript in Web Pages

In order to include JavaScript to a web page we must use the `<script></script>` tag to reference the JavaScript.

- We can reference JavaScript directly in the `script` tag or
- We can reference an external JavaScript file and use the `script` tag with the src attribute specifying the path to the file. Multiple imports (even of the same file) are possible and normal.

In general it is better to use external JavaScript files, because it is easier to read, and put the script tags in the body of the HTML.

**_Why should we put JavaScript in the body tag?_**

JavaScript in the `head` tag is read before the elements in the body are displayed. So if the JavaScript tries to change a webpage element, we might get an error because the elements are not yet displayed, so putting the scripts at the bottom of the `body` tag ensure that the element have displayed before the JavaScript is read. The JavaScript code can be added as:

- **Inline JavaScript Code**

  - Executed directly when the browser (HTML parse) reaches the script tag
  - Typically only used for very trivial websites/scripts

- **External JavaScript File**

  - Requested and loaded when the browser (HTML parser) reaches the script tag
  - Execution behavior depends on configurations: **async** and **defer** allows HTML parser to continue

External JavaScript File configurations:

- **Inline** - Immediately executed, blocks HTML parsing & rendering

- **External File** - Immediately loaded & executed, blocks HTML parsing & rendering

- **External File (async)** - Immediately loaded & and executed thereafter, blocks HTML parsing & rendering

- **External File (defer)** - Immediately loaded & but executed after HTML parsing and rendering

- **External File (async & defer)** - If both are present and the browser only supports defer then it will fall back to the defer behavior. These attributes only make sense when using the script in the head portion of the page, and they are useless if you put the script in the body footer.

Importing JavaScript depends from case to case, but to get the best of both worlds do the following:

- Import the scripts in the **HEAD** section of the **HTML** and use **defer**
- Use **async** if you have a **standalone script that does not depend** on the content of the HTML

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="external-file.js" defer></script>
    <script src="external-file.js" async></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- defer at the end of the body has no effect -->
  </body>
</html>
```
