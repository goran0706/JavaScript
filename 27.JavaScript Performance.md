# High Performance Web Sites

## Rules

1. **Make fewer HTTP requests.** - eliminates unnecessary HTTP requests
2. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)** - improves response times by bringing the HTTP response closer to the user.
3. **Reduce DNS lookups** - Keep-Alive also reduces DNS look-ups.
4. **Add an Expires Header** (Expires Header, Max-Age and mod_expires) - eliminates unnecessary HTTP requests
5. **Gzip Components** (Gzip your scripts and stylesheets.) - reduces response times by reducing the size of the HTTP response. Generally, it’s worth gzipping any file greater than 1 or 2K.
6. **Make Ajax Cacheable**
7. **Put CSS at the Top** - avoid Blank White Screen & CSS Flash of Unstyled Content
8. **Put Scripts at the Bottom** - or use defer and/or async attributes.
9. **Don't put `<script>` right after a `<link>` tag referencing a stylesheet.**
10. **Group scripts together.** The fewer `<script>` tags on the page, the faster the page can be loaded and become interactive.
11. **Dynamically load JavaScript modules**
12. **Dynamically create `<script>` elements to download and execute the code**
13. **Remove Duplicate Scripts**
14. **Make JavaScript and CSS External**
15. **Minify JavaScript** (Minification, Obfuscation)
16. **Avoid Redirects**
17. **Avoid CSS expressions**
18. **Configure ETags**
19. **Store any frequently used out-of-scope variables in local variables**, and then access the local variables directly - improves deeply nested objects property access and write, closures
20. **Extract deep nested object properties and methods as local variables.**
21. **Avoid using with()** - temporarily augments the execution context’s scope chain while it is being executed.
22. **Reduce usage of try/catch()** - temporarily augments the execution context’s scope chain while it is being executed.
23. **Minimize the performance impact of the catch clause by executing as little code as necessary within it.** A good pattern is to have a method for handling errors that the catch clause can delegate to.
24. **Avoid using eval()** - use dynamic scopes only when absolutely necessary. When a dynamic scope is involved, however, this optimization is no longer valid. The engines need to switch back to a slower hash-based approach for identifier resolution that more closely mirrors traditional scope chain lookup.
25. **Minimize DOM access, and try to work as much as possible in JavaScript.**
26. Convert HTML Collection into an array for heavy work on collections. HTML Collections also represent the live, underlying document, changes immediately updated.
27. **Use local variables to store DOM references you’ll access repeatedly.**
28. **Use faster APIs when available**, such as querySelectorAll() and firstElementChild. nextSibling performs much better than childNodes
29. **Avoid using methods that do not distinguish between nodes and element nodes**, as it will include more items in case of loops - unless necessary.
30. **Combine multiple DOM and style changes into a batch and apply them once**. Reflows and repaints can be expensive, and therefore a good strategy for responsive applications is to reduce their number.
31. **Avoiding DOM access in loops**
32. **Assigning DOM references to local variables and working with the locals**
33. **Using selectors API where available**
34. **Caching the length when iterating over HTML collections**
35. **Use event delegation to minimize the number of event handlers.**
36. **Optimize Loops:**

    - **Decreasing the work per iteration**
    - **Decreasing the number of iterations**
    - **Avoid function-based iterations**
    - **Batch Processing**: Instead of processing one item at a time, process multiple items in each iteration. This reduces loop overhead and can lead to significant performance gains. However, it's only applicable to specific use cases.
    - **Caching Function Calls**: If your loop involves calling functions repeatedly with the same arguments, you can cache the function results outside the loop to avoid redundant calls.
    - **Inline Simple Functions**: If you have simple functions or operations inside the loop, consider inlining them, especially if they are small. This can save the function call overhead.
    - **Optimize Array Access**: Accessing array elements can be expensive, especially for large arrays. If possible, optimize array access by restructuring the data or using data structures more suitable for your use case.
    - **Use Typed Arrays**: If your loop operates on a large amount of numerical data, consider using typed arrays like Float32Array or Uint8Array, which are more memory-efficient and can lead to performance improvements.
    - **Avoid Creating Objects**: Minimize the creation of objects within the loop, as object creation can be expensive. Reuse objects or initialize them outside the loop when possible.
    - **Parallel Processing**: If your use case allows, you can explore the use of Web Workers or similar techniques to parallelize loop processing across multiple threads, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core CPUs.
    - **Benchmark and Profile**: Always use profiling tools to measure the performance impact of your optimizations. The most effective optimization may vary depending on your specific use case and the JavaScript engine you're working with.

37. **Use Timers** - Timers can be used to schedule code for later execution, which allows you to split up long-running scripts into a series of smaller tasks.
38. **Use Web Workers for multi-threading and background processing.** - Web workers are a feature in newer browsers that allow you to execute JavaScript code outside of the UI thread, thus preventing UI locking.

## Loading and execution

Every time a `<script>` tag is encountered, the page must stop and wait for the code to download (if external) and execute before continuing to process the rest of the page.

**Script Positioning:**

- Put all `<script>` tags at the bottom of the page, just inside of the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures that the page can be almost completely rendered before script execution begins.
- Do not put `<script>` tag right after a `<link>` tag referencing a stylesheet.

**Grouping Scripts:**

- Group scripts together. The fewer `<script>` tags on the page, the faster the page can be loaded and become interactive. This holds true both for `<script>` tags loading external JavaScript files and those with inline code.

**Non-blocking Scripts**

- Use the async attribute of the `<script>` tag
- Use the defer attribute of the `<script>` tag
- Dynamically load JavaScript modules
- Dynamically create `<script>` elements to download and execute the code
- Download the JavaScript code using an XHR object, and then inject the code into the page

## Data Access

One of the classic computer science problems is determining where data should be stored for optimal reading and writing.
Where data is stored is related to how quickly it can be retrieved during code execution.

**Scope Chains and Identifier Resolution**

The deeper into the execution context’s scope chain an identifier exists, the slower it is to access for both reads and writes. Consequently, local variables are always the fastest to access inside of a function, whereas global variables will generally be the slowest. Keep in mind that global variables always exist in the last variable object of the execution context’s scope chain, so they are always the furthest away to resolve.

- Always store out-of-scope values in local variables if they are used more than once within a function.
- Extract deep nested object properties and methods as local variables.

**Scope Chain Augmentation**

An execution context’s scope chain doesn’t change. There are, however, two statements (with() & try/catch) that temporarily augment the execution context’s scope chain while it is being executed.

- Avoid using with()
- Functions are optimized, try/catch is not, wrap code into functions.
- Minimize the performance impact of the catch clause by executing as little code as necessary within it. A good pattern is to have a method for handling errors that the catch clause can delegate to.

**Dynamic Scope**

- Avoid using eval() - use dynamic scopes only when absolutely necessary. When a dynamic scope is involved, however, this optimization is no longer valid. The engines need to switch back to a slower hash-based approach for identifier resolution that more closely mirrors traditional scope chain lookup.

**Closures, Scope, and Memory**

It’s best to exercise caution when using closures in your scripts, as they have both memory and execution speed concerns. However, you can mitigate the execution speed impact by following the advice from earlier in this chapter regarding out-of-scope variables:

- Store any frequently used out-of-scope variables in local variables, and then access the local variables directly.

**Summary:**

- Where you store and access data in JavaScript can have a measurable impact on the overall performance of your code.
- There are four places to access data from: literal values, variables, array items, and object members.
- These locations all have different performance considerations.
- Literal values and local variables can be accessed very quickly, whereas array items and object members take longer.
- Local variables are faster to access than out-of-scope variables because they exist in the first variable object of the scope chain. The further into the scope chain a variable is, the longer it takes to access. Global variables are always the slowest to access because they are always last in the scope chain.
- Avoid the with() statement because it augments the execution context scope chain. Also, be careful with the catch clause of a try-catch statement because it has the same effect.
- Nested object members incur significant performance impact and should be minimized.
- The deeper into the prototype chain that a property or method exists, the slower it is to access.
- Generally speaking, you can improve the performance of JavaScript code by storing frequently used object members, array items, and out-of-scope variables in local variables.
  You can then access the local variables faster than the originals.

## DOM Scripting

**DOM Inherently Slow**

- Minimize DOM access, and try to work as much as possible in JavaScript.

**DOM Access and Modification**

- Use innerHTML over other DOM methods to update the DOM - innerHTML is more than three times faster in IE6 and slightly slower in the latest WebKit browsers.
- cloning nodes over creating new - Another way of updating page contents using DOM methods is to clone existing DOM elements instead of creating new ones—in other words,
  using element.cloneNode() (where element is an existing node) instead of document.createElement().

**HTML Collections**

The HTML collections are in fact queries against the document, and these queries are being re-executed every time you need up-to-date information,
such as the number of elements in the collection (i.e., the collection’s length). This could be a source of inefficiencies.

- Copy HTML Collection into an array. Be careful when dealing with HTML collections because they represent the live, underlying document.
  Cache the collection length into a variable and use it when iterating, and make a copy of the collection into an array for heavy work on collections.
- Use local variables to store DOM references you’ll access repeatedly.

**Traversing the DOM**

- Use faster APIs when available, such as querySelectorAll() and firstElementChild.
- nextSibling performs much better than childNodes
- prefer querySelect() & querySelectAll()
- avoid using methods that do not distinguish between nodes and element nodes, as it will include more items in case of loops - unless necessary.

**Repaints and Reflows**

- Combine multiple DOM and style changes into a batch and apply them once. Reflows and repaints can be expensive, and therefore a good strategy for responsive applications is to reduce their number.

**Events**

- Use event delegation to minimize the number of event handlers.

## Algorithms and Flow Control

**Loop Performance**

There are actually just two factors:

- Work done per iteration
- Number of iterations

  By decreasing either or both of these, you can positively impact the overall performance of the loop.

**Loops Optimizations:**

- Decreasing the work per iteration
- Decreasing the number of iterations
- Avoid function-based iterations

- **Batch Processing**: Instead of processing one item at a time, process multiple items in each iteration. This reduces loop overhead and can lead to significant performance gains. However, it's only applicable to specific use cases.
- **Caching Function Calls**: If your loop involves calling functions repeatedly with the same arguments, you can cache the function results outside the loop to avoid redundant calls.
- **Inline Simple Functions**: If you have simple functions or operations inside the loop, consider inlining them, especially if they are small. This can save the function call overhead.
- **Optimize Array Access**: Accessing array elements can be expensive, especially for large arrays. If possible, optimize array access by restructuring the data or using data structures more suitable for your use case.
- **Use Typed Arrays**: If your loop operates on a large amount of numerical data, consider using typed arrays like Float32Array or Uint8Array, which are more memory-efficient and can lead to performance improvements.
- **Avoid Creating Objects**: Minimize the creation of objects within the loop, as object creation can be expensive. Reuse objects or initialize them outside the loop when possible.
- **Parallel Processing**: If your use case allows, you can explore the use of Web Workers or similar techniques to parallelize loop processing across multiple threads, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core CPUs.
- **Benchmark and Profile**: Always use profiling tools to measure the performance impact of your optimizations. The most effective optimization may vary depending on your specific use case and the JavaScript engine you're working with.

**Summary:**

- The for, while, and do-while loops all have similar performance characteristics, and so no one loop type is significantly faster or slower than the others.
- Avoid the for-in loop unless you need to iterate over a number of unknown object properties.
- The best ways to improve loop performance are to decrease the amount of work done per iteration and decrease the number of loop iterations.
- Generally speaking, switch is always faster than if-else, but isn’t always the best solution.
- Lookup tables are a faster alternative to multiple condition evaluation using if- else or switch.
- Browser call stack size limits the amount of recursion that JavaScript is allowed to perform; stack overflow errors prevent the rest of the code from executing.
- If you run into a stack overflow error, change the method to an iterative algorithm or make use of memoization to avoid work repetition.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

/* sub-optimal loop */
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  // process
}

/* optimized, the length is not evaluated with each iteration */
for (let i = 0, n = arr.length; i < n; i++) {
  // process
}

/* optimized, and reversed */
for (let i = arr.length; i--; ) {
  // process
}
```

```js
let i = 0,
  n = arr.length;

while (i < n) {
  // process
  i++;
}

do {
  // process
  i++;
} while (i < n);
```

```js
let k = arr.length;

while (k--) {
  // process
  k++;
}

do {
  // process
  k++;
} while (k--);
```

## Strings and Regular Expressions

- When concatenating numerous or large strings, array joining is the only method with reasonable performance in IE7 and earlier.
- If you don’t need to worry about IE7 and earlier, array joining is one of the slowest ways to concatenate strings.
  Use simple + and += operators instead, and avoid unnecessary intermediate strings.

## Responsive Interfaces

- No JavaScript task should take longer than 100 milliseconds to execute. Longer execution times cause a noticeable delay in updates to the UI and negatively impact the overall user experience.
- Timers can be used to schedule code for later execution, which allows you to split up long-running scripts into a series of smaller tasks.
- Web workers are a feature in newer browsers that allow you to execute JavaScript code outside of the UI thread, thus preventing UI locking.

**Web Workers**

- Web workers represent a potentially huge performance improvement for web applications because each new worker spawns its own thread in which to execute JavaScript.
  That means not only will code executing in a worker not affect the browser UI, but it also won’t affect code executing in other workers.

## Programming Practices

- Avoid the double evaluation penalty by avoiding the use of eval() and the Function() constructor. Also, pass functions into setTimeout() and setInterval() instead of strings.
- Use object and array literals when creating new objects and arrays. They are created and initialized faster than non-literal forms.
- Avoid doing the same work repeatedly. Use lazy loading or conditional advance loading when browser-detection logic is necessary.
- When performing mathematical operations, consider using bitwise operators that work directly on the underlying representation of the number.
- Native methods are always faster than anything you can write in JavaScript. Use native methods whenever available.
- Use fast parts, like Bitwise AND 1 instead of modulo %

## Building and Deploying High Performance Application

- Combining JavaScript files to reduce the number of HTTP requests
- Minifying JavaScript files using the YUI Compressor
- Serving JavaScript files compressed (gzip encoding)
- Making JavaScript files cacheable by setting the appropriate HTTP response headers and work around caching issues by appending a timestamp to filenames
- Using a Content Delivery Network to serve JavaScript files; not only will a CDN improve performance, it should also manage compression and caching for you.
