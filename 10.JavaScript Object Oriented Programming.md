# JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) is a paradigm of programming in which programs are written and structured around objects rather than functions or logic. Here, objects are defined as data fields that have unique attributes and behavior. They contain data in the form of attributes and procedures in the form of methods. Object procedures can access and modify the data present in an object.

- OOP = Object Oriented Programming
- Use OOP to model real world things in code (cars, users, orders, etcetera)
- Objects container data and behaviors

## Classes & Instances

**Classes:**

- Classes are blueprints for objects.
- JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
- Classes define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
- Classes make creation of multiple similar objects much easier

**Objects:**

- Objects are collections of key/value pairs. Complex reference types.
- Instances of classes (based on classes)
- Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals.

## Class Fields & Properties

```js
class Product {
  static instanceId = 0 // public class field
  category = "DEFAULT"; // public instance property

  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title; // public instance property
  }

  printInfo() {
    console.log(Product.instanceId, this.title, this.category);
  }
}
```

## Static vs Instance

**Static Field/Property/Method:**

- Defined with _static_ keyword
- Only accessible on class itself, without instantiation
- Typically used in helper classes, global configuration etc.

**Instance Field/Property/Method:**

- Defined without _static_ keyword
- Only accessible on instances
- Used for core, re-usable logic

## Public vs Private

**Public:**

- Accessible outside of the class/object

**Private:**

- Accessible only inside of the class/object

## When to use Classes

Classes are great when we re-create the same type of object over and over again. Requires more overhead initially but provide easy "object duplication thereafter.

Object are great for general data grouping, objects which we only create once. Quick and easy to create, no overhead.

## Constructor Functions vs Classes

**Constructor Functions:**

- Blueprint for Objects
- Properties & Methods
- Can be called with new
- All properties and methods are enumerable
- Not in strict mode by default

**Classes:**

- Blueprint for Objects
- Properties & Methods
- Must be called with new
- Methods are non-enumerable by default
- Always in strict mode

Classes are just a syntactical sugar added in JavaScript, but behind the scene it works with prototypes. JavaScript itself is a prototypal language.
JavaScript automatically looks into the prototype of the object and searches for the property or method there.

## Different Kinds of Method Declarations

**Method Shorthand** - Assigned to Person's prototype and hence shared across all instances (Not re-created per instance)

```js
class Person {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hi");
  }
}
```

**Property Function** - Assigned to individual instances and hence re-created per object. _this_ refers to what called the method.

```js
class Person {
  greet = function() {...}

  constructor() {
    this.greet2 = function() {...}
  }
}
```

**Property Arrow Function** - Assigned to individual instances and hence re-created per object. _this_ always refers to the instance.

```js
class Person {
  greet = () => {...}

  constructor() {
    this.greet2 = () => {...}
  }
}
```

### ES6 Class and Inheritance

```js
class Parent {
  // Public field, visible and accessible
  public_field = "public field";

  // Private field, visible but not accessible (not actually private)
  #private_field = "private field";

  // Static field, belongs to the class, but not the instances.
  static field;

  // Constructor function
  constructor(prop1, prop2) {
    // Control the instantiation (make parent class non-instantiable)
    if (Parent === new.target)
      throw new Error("Parent class cannot be instantiated");

    this.prop1 = prop1;
    this.prop2 = prop2;

    // Private property (real private)
    const private_prop = "Real private property";

    // Create an instance method to access the private property
    this.access_private_prop = function () {
      console.log(private_prop);
    };
  }

  // 3 Method types: instance, prototype, static
  instance_method = function () {
    console.log("Parent INSTANCE method");
  };
  prototype_method() {
    console.log("Parent PROTOTYPE method");
  }
  static static_method() {
    console.log("Parent STATIC method");
  }

  // Getters and Setters (Accessors and Mutators)
  get access_prop1() {
    return this.prop1;
  }
  set access_prop1(arg) {
    this.prop1 = arg;
  }

  get access_prop2() {
    return this.prop2;
  }
  set access_prop2(arg) {
    this.prop2 = arg;
  }
}
```

```js
class Child extends Parent {
  // Constructor function
  constructor(prop1, prop2, prop3) {
    // Extend parent properties
    super(prop1, prop2);
    this.prop3 = prop3;
  }

  // 3 Method types: instance, prototype, static
  instance_method = function () {
    console.log("Child INSTANCE method");
    // Extend parents methods - cannot override instance methods
    // super.instance_method(); // 'super' keyword unexpected here
  };

  prototype_method() {
    console.log("Child PROTOTYPE method");
    // Extend parents methods
    super.prototype_method();
  }

  static static_method() {
    console.log("Child STATIC method");
    // Extend parents methods
    super.static_method();
  }

  // Getters and Setters (Accessors and Mutators)
  get access_prop3() {
    return this.prop3;
  }
  set access_prop3(arg) {
    this.prop3 = arg;
  }
}

// const instance = new Parent(1, 2, 3); // Uncaught Error: Parent class cannot be instantiated
const instance = new Child(1, 2, 3); // Uncaught Error: Parent class cannot be instantiated
```

### ES6 Class Composition (Mixins)

```js
class Truck {
  constructor() {
    this.brand = "Mercedes-Benz";
    this.model = "Splinter";
  }
}

function PetrolEngine(cls) {
  return class extends cls {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.engine = "Petrol";
    }
  };
}

function ElectricEngine(cls) {
  return class extends cls {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.engine = "Electric";
    }
  };
}

function AutomaticGearbox(cls) {
  return class extends cls {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.gearbox = "Automatic";
    }
  };
}

function ManualGearbox(cls) {
  return class extends cls {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.gearbox = "Manual";
    }
  };
}

// Construct the Truck mixin (composition)
const TruckComposition = AutomaticGearbox(PetrolEngine(Truck));
const truck = new TruckComposition();
console.log(truck);
```

### ES6 Class vs. Constructor Function Differences

```js
// 1. Define Constructor Function
function Car_constructor_function(engine, gearbox) {
  this.engine = engine;
  this.gearbox = gearbox;
}

// 2. Change the prototype object (the prototype object can be changed)
Car_constructor_function.prototype = { proto: "New proto..." };

// 3. Create an instance
const car_instance1 = new Car_constructor_function("Petrol", "Manual");

// 4. The prototype object can be changed, it is not protected when using a constructor function - writable: true
console.log(
  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Car_constructor_function, "prototype")
);
```

```js
// 1. Define class
class Car_constructor_class {
  constructor(engine, gearbox) {
    this.engine = engine;
    this.gearbox = gearbox;
  }
}

// 2. Change the prototype object
Car_constructor_function.prototype = { proto: "New proto..." };

// 3. Create an instance
const car_instance2 = new Car_constructor_class("Petrol", "Manual");

// 4. The prototype object cannot be changed, it is protected when using a class - writable: false
console.log(
  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Car_constructor_class, "prototype")
);
```

# Object-oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods to manipulate that data. OOP is guided by several key principles or "pillars" that help structure and design software in a more modular and organized way. The four main pillars of OOP are:

**Encapsulation:**

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. This unit serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components, typically by using access modifiers like public, private, and protected. This helps in maintaining data integrity and reducing unintended interference.

**Abstraction:**

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they exhibit, while hiding unnecessary details.
It allows you to create classes with a well-defined interface (public methods) that abstract away the underlying complexity. Users of the class only need to know how to use its public methods without worrying about the internal implementation.

**Inheritance:**

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to define a new class (a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (a superclass or base class). The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass.
Inheritance promotes code reuse, as it allows you to create specialized classes that inherit common characteristics from a more general class. This hierarchical structure can reduce code duplication and make the code more maintainable.

**Polymorphism:**

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means that you can use a single interface (method or function) to work with different types of objects.
There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). Method overriding, in particular, is a fundamental concept in OOP, where a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass.

### Object-oriented JavaScript

Leave behind the notions of **classes** and **class-based inheritance** and learn about **prototype-based inheritance** and **constructor functions** that behave similarly.

JavaScript tracks variables for a particular scope with a variable object. Primitive values are stored directly on the **variable object**, while reference values are placed as a pointer in the variable object, which serves as a reference to a location in memory where the object is stored.

JavaScript’s built-in approach for inheritance is called prototype chaining, or prototypal inheritance. Prototype properties are automatically available on object instances, which is a form of inheritance. The object instances inherit properties from the prototype. Because the prototype is also an object, it has its own prototype and inherits properties from that. This is the prototype chain: An object inherits from its prototype, while that prototype in turn inherits from its prototype, and so on. More specifically, all objects inherit from Object.prototype.

## Object Inheritance

```js
var book = {
  title: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript",
};

// is the same as

// creates a book object by inheriting the Object.prototype properties and adding a new property 'title'
var book = Object.create(Object.prototype, {
  title: {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    value: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript",
    writable: true,
  },
});

// Another object inheritance example
var person1 = {
  name: "Nicholas",
  sayName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

var person2 = Object.create(person1, {
  name: {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    value: "Greg",
    writable: true,
  },
});
```

## Constructor Inheritance

```js
// you write this
function YourConstructor() {
  // initialization
}

// JavaScript engine does this for you behind the scenes
YourConstructor.prototype = Object.create(Object.prototype, {
  constructor: {
    value: YourConstructor,
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true,
  },
});
```

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}
Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function () {
  return this.length * this.width;
};
Rectangle.prototype.toString = function () {
  return "[Rectangle " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};

// example 1: inherits from Rectangle
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}
Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype, {
  constructor: {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    value: Square,
    writable: true,
  },
});
Square.prototype.toString = function () {
  return "[Square " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};

// example 2: inherits from Rectangle
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = new Rectangle();
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;
Square.prototype.toString = function () {
  return "[Square " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};
```

**Generally, you’ll modify the prototype for method inheritance and use constructor stealing for properties.** This approach is typically referred to as **pseudoclassical inheritance** because it mimics classical inheritance from class-based languages.

JavaScript supports inheritance through **prototype chaining**. A prototype chain is created between objects when the **[[Prototype]]** of one object is set equal to another. All generic objects automatically inherit from Object **.prototype**. If you want to create an object that inherits from something else, you can use Object.create() to specify the value of [[Prototype]] for a new object. You accomplish inheritance between custom types by creating a prototype chain on the constructor. By setting the constructor’s prototype property to another value, you create inheritance between instances of the custom type and the prototype of that other value. All instances of that constructor share the same prototype, so they all inherit from the same object. This technique works very well for inheriting methods from other objects, but you cannot inherit own properties using prototypes. To inherit own properties correctly, you can use constructor stealing, which is simply calling a constructor function using call() or apply() so that any initialization is done on the subtype object. Combining constructor stealing and prototype chaining is the most common way to achieve inheritance between custom types in JavaScript. **This combination is frequently called pseudo­classical inheritance** because of its similarity to inheritance in class-based languages. You can access methods on a supertype by directly accessing the supertype’s prototype. In doing so, you must use call() or apply() to execute the supertype method on the subtype object.

## Object Patterns

**Module Pattern**

**The module pattern is an object-creation pattern designed to create singleton objects with private data**. The basic approach is to use an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object. An IIFE is a function expression that is defined and then called immediately to produce a result. That function expression can contain any number of local variables that aren’t accessible from outside that function. Because the returned object is defined within that function, the object’s methods have access to the data. (All objects defined within the IIFE have access to the same local variables.) Methods that access private data in this way are called privileged methods.

```js
// Singleton object with private data
var yourObject = (function () {
  // private data variables

  return {
    // public methods and properties
  };
})();
```

**Revealing Module Pattern**

There is a variation of the module pattern called the **revealing module pattern**, which arranges all variables and methods at the top of the IIFE and simply assigns them to the returned object. Effectively **“revealing”** them outside the IIFE. It is essentially the same as the earlier example using the traditional module pattern; however, some prefer this pattern because it keeps all variable and function declarations together.

```js
// Singleton object with private data
var yourObject = (function () {
  // private data variables

  // functions/getter/setter

  return {
    // public methods and properties
    // key: value pair
  };
})();
```

**Private Members for Constructors**

```js
// Singleton object with private data
var yourObject = (function () {
  // private data variables
  let age = 18;

  this.getAge = function () {
    return age;
  };
})();
```

## ES6 Class

```js
class Parent {
  #privateParentProp = "private_parent_prop";

  constructor(parentPublicProp) {
    this._parentPublicProp = parentPublicProp;
  }

  get privateParentProp() {
    return this.#privateParentProp;
  }

  set privateParentProp(value) {
    this.#privateParentProp = value;
  }

  get parentPublicProp() {
    return this._parentPublicProp;
  }

  set parentPublicProp(value) {
    this._parentPublicProp = value;
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  constructor(parentPublicProp, childProp) {
    super(parentPublicProp);
    this.childProp = childProp;
  }

  getChildProp() {
    return this.childProp;
  }

  setChildProp(value) {
    this.childProp = value;
  }
}
```

JavaScript object composition is an alternative approach to traditional inheritance-based object-oriented programming. Instead of using inheritance to create new objects with shared behaviors, you compose objects by combining or aggregating them to achieve the desired functionality. This approach is often referred to as **"composition over inheritance"** and is considered more flexible and versatile. Here's how you can achieve object composition in JavaScript:

**Object Literal Composition:**

You can create a new object by combining properties and methods from multiple objects using object literals.

```js
const canEat = {
  eat() {
    console.log("Eating...");
  },
};

const canSleep = {
  sleep() {
    console.log("Sleeping...");
  },
};

const animal = {
  name: "Fido",
};

const dog = { ...animal, ...canEat, ...canSleep };
dog.eat();
dog.sleep();
```

**Factory Functions:**

You can create factory functions that return new objects with a combination of properties and methods.

```js
function createDog(name) {
  const dog = { name };

  return {
    ...dog,
    ...canEat,
    ...canSleep,
  };
}

const myDog = createDog("Buddy");
myDog.eat();
myDog.sleep();
```

**Mixin Functions:**

Mixins are functions that take an object and mix in (add) properties and methods. Here's an example:

```js
function mixin(target, ...sources) {
  Object.assign(target, ...sources);
}

const dog = { name: "Max" };
mixin(dog, canEat, canSleep);
dog.eat();
dog.sleep();
```

**Composition with Classes (ES6):**

You can also use classes to compose objects, though this is more about creating classes that contain instances of other classes or objects.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Eater {
  eat() {
    console.log("Eating...");
  }
}

class Sleeper {
  sleep() {
    console.log("Sleeping...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this.eater = new Eater();
    this.sleeper = new Sleeper();
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Rex");
myDog.eater.eat();
myDog.sleeper.sleep();
```
